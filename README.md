<h1 align='center'>ESX Christmas Tree</a></h1>

### Current problems

- Duplication of fir trees (visible in case of shock)

### To do

- Apply the rotation of the entity, if the ground is not flat
- Allow only some vehicles to wear the tree, even if it should be logical in RP
- Change the keys used
